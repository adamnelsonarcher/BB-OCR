Becker’s Books AI Tool – OSV Fellowship Progress Report (Month 1)
Prepared by: Charlie Becker
Collaborator: Adam Nelson-Archer
Period Covered: Month 1 of OSV Fellowship
Project Goal: Build an AI-enhanced system to identify, price, and help list used books—starting with non-ISBN books—while preserving the culture and speed of analog bookstores.

🔧 Technical Milestones and System Overview
We finalized and reviewed the schematic for the BBOCR (Book Barcode OCR) system, which has five main components (“swim lanes”) and is divided into three project phases:
✅ Phase 1: Image to Structured Data (Blue Zone)
Goal: Convert user-captured book images into structured JSON { title, author, year }
Components:
Image Capture (Steps 1–2)
Image Preprocessing (Step 3–4 using OpenCV)
OCR Engine (Step 5 – EasyOCR/Tesseract/Google Vision)
Heuristics Parser (Step 6 – Regex rules + LLM fallback)
Output: Structured JSON (Step 7)


Quarter 1 Target:
 A robust pipeline for converting images to structured JSON across edge cases (i.e., vintage books, odd typography, no ISBN). This is the backbone of the entire system and the foundation for future enrichment, pricing, and listing.

🔶 Phase 2: Search, Enrich, Verify (Orange Zone)
Search Orchestrator (Step 8): Queries a local book database (PostgreSQL) to check for matches.
If not found, we query multiple APIs in parallel (Google Books, OpenLibrary, AbeBooks).
Verification UI (Step 13): Human confirms correctness of metadata.
Full Book Record (Step 14): Becomes a persistent JSON file in our local DB.
🔍 Clarification: The “Fast Lane” logic allows us to skip API calls when a local match exists—saving cost and time.

🔴 Phase 3: Finalize & Integrate (Red Zone)
Integration Module (Step 15): Sends confirmed data to:


BookTrakker via CSV or RPA automation
Label printer for analog inventory
Our local database for future lookups

🧠 AI Integration Summary
Step
Component
How AI is Used
5
OCR Engine
Uses EasyOCR or Tesseract to extract characters from images. Fine-tuning or benchmarking against GPT-4 Vision or Google Vision is underway.
6
Heuristics Parser
AI parses raw text using regex + possibly GPT/Claude in edge cases to label title/author/year.
8
Search Orchestrator
Fuzzy matching algorithms (e.g. Levenshtein, FuzzyWuzzy) to handle errors and reduce API calls.
15
Pricing Engine (NEW)
A planned regression model + logic rule system. Will be trained on internal pricing history and later refined via interviews with bookstore founder (Charlie's dad).

AI is not used for its own sake, but to:
Improve speed and accuracy
Reduce dependency on costly third-party APIs
Capture institutional knowledge (e.g. pricing strategy) in code

💵 New Component: Pricing Engine (Step 15)
Why it's needed:
Online prices are inconsistent and often irrelevant.
Pricing reflects real-world judgment, floor thresholds, and bookstore-specific logic.
Planned Implementation:
Rule-based logic (e.g. no book < $7)
Trained ML model based on Becker’s Books historical pricing
Final output: JSON record + suggested price + logic summary
Later: human confirmation, override, or approval
Note: Image-to-JSON ≠ Price. This new step formalizes that distinction.

🖼️ Photo Handling Update
Added support for two types of image output:
OCR Image – high contrast, optimized for text extraction
Listing Image – color-accurate, white background, linked via file path in JSON
Final book.json will include a reference to a listing-ready photo. Images are not embedded in JSON directly, but referenced by path or URL (e.g., "images/book123.jpg").
🗓️ Timeline: Steps 1–7 (Quarter 1 Goal)

Total Time Estimate: ~4 weeks
 Benchmark goal: match barcode scanner speed (~1.5 seconds), 100% accuracy, near-zero cost

🧾 Budget Notes
Developer/technical collaborator is being funded at ~$2,000/month.
Additional reimbursements (e.g. for tools, image hosting, hardware) are allowed up to $200–$300 without preapproval.
Payment may occasionally lag but will be reconciled monthly or bimonthly.
CPA is being consulted to formalize contractor setup and minimize tax implications.

📸 Next Actions
Bookstore Session:
Charlie will schedule photo session (200–300 images for testing)
Flowchart Update:
Integrate Pricing Engine (Step 15) and image listing logic
Begin Dev Work:
Build & test image → structured JSON pipeline
Create basic UI for human-in-the-loop confirmation
Interviews & Modeling (Q2):
Interview Charlie’s dad to formalize pricing rules
Begin groundwork for regression model

📍 Key Takeaways
The OCR + JSON pipeline (Steps 1–7) is the critical deliverable for Quarter 1 and is on track.
A new Pricing Engine (Step 15) was added to support a sustainable, automated listing system.
AI is tightly scoped to where it provides true value—extraction, labeling, matching, and pricing.
The team is aligned, budgeted, and focused on delivering early wins without overengineering.
